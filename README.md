# DL- Developing a Deep Learning Model for NER using LSTM

## AIM
To develop an LSTM-based model for recognizing the named entities in the text.

## THEORY


## Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1: 

Load data, create word/tag mappings, and group sentences.

### STEP 2: 

Convert sentences to index sequences, pad to fixed length, and split into training/testing sets.

### STEP 3: 

Define dataset and DataLoader for batching.

### STEP 4: 

Build a bidirectional LSTM model for sequence tagging.

### STEP 5: 

Train the model over multiple epochs, tracking loss.

### STEP 6: 

Evaluate model accuracy, plot loss curves, and visualize predictions on a sample.
